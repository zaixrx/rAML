# About Project
because the things I make are variable to the feeling I have
towards them (and skill issue lol) I didn't want to continue
working on the previous implementation of AML mainly because
of how slow it was, specifically the tree-walk interpreter, hence
the need for optimizations which require a deep understanding
of how Go does memory management (a big no-no -- for now)

so as any reasonable person would do (maybe) I said fuck it and
finally found a serious reason to use Rust, so this project -- a bytecode
interpreter with its own stack-based virtual machine -- is supposed
to be my first project and an exercise in learning Rust, so expect
to see painfully ugly and slow code (if you are a Rust expert and
willing to look at my janky code anyway)
